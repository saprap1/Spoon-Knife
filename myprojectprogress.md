I mentioned this one in the first lab, but some options I'm thinking about are continuing my AutoCalendar project from RCOS last semester. I would probably work on a common repository where there would be branches for each feature and team members would make pull requests to merge to master. I would do this because I have more experience with this kind of set up. Another project I'm thinking about is a program to predict the best picks for fantasy teams (I am a football fan, so I think that a program like this would be cool for next season). Again, would probably work on a common repository.
